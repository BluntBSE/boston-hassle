## Other Required Stuff

- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)
- [sass](https://sass-lang.com/install)

## Installation
- clone the repo into your wp-content/themes folder
- run `npm install`
- since the stylesheet is not tracked, you'll need to create one. make a directory under `library/` called `stylesheets/`, then run `sass --watch sass:stylesheets` to track Sass changes and compile them into CSS

## Notes

The CSS on this project was written in Sass. The CSS files are not tracked in this repo, so you will need to run the compiler to have the website not look terrible in your environment. Please do not edit the CSS files directly!

NOTE: If you make changes to the theme and are not using versioning such as Git for whatever reason, please log your changes below!
